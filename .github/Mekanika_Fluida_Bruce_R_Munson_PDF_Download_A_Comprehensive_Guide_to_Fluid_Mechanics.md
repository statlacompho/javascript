## What is Mekanika Fluida?
 
Mekanika Fluida is a textbook that covers the basic principles and applications of fluid mechanics. It is written for undergraduate students in engineering, science, and agriculture. The book aims to help students develop the skills and confidence they need to master the art of solving fluid mechanics problems. It does so by providing effective pedagogy, everyday examples, and an outstanding collection of practical problems.
 
The book is divided into two volumes: Jilid 1 and Jilid 2. Jilid 1 covers the topics of fluid statics, fluid kinematics, conservation laws, dimensional analysis and similitude, viscous flow in pipes, flow over immersed bodies, potential flow and computational fluid dynamics (CFD), and compressible flow. Jilid 2 covers the topics of open-channel flow, turbomachinery, introduction to boundary layers, drag and lift, compressible flow through nozzles and diffusers, normal shock waves and oblique shock waves, expansion waves and supersonic flow, compressible flow with friction and heat transfer.
