# Theory of Computation Book by Puntambekar: A Review
 
Theory of Computation is a subject that deals with the study of abstract machines, formal languages, computability and complexity. It is one of the core topics for computer science students and researchers. A good book on this subject can help in understanding the concepts and solving problems related to automata, grammars, Turing machines, decidability and more.

One of the popular books on this subject is Theory of Computation by A.A. Puntambekar. This book covers all the topics required for GATE and other competitive exams in a concise and clear manner. It also contains a large number of solved examples and exercise questions to test the understanding of the readers.
 
In this article, we will review the book Theory of Computation by Puntambekar and highlight its features, content, exercises and usefulness for GATE aspirants.
 
## Features of the Book
 
The book Theory of Computation by Puntambekar has the following features:
 
- It covers all the GATE topics in detail without getting verbose.
- It explains the content in a simple and straightforward language.
- It makes the subject fun to read and easy to grasp.
- It is suitable for beginners as well as intermediate students.
- Turing Machines and Undecidability are covered in a very clear and crisp manner.
- It contains a large number of exercise questions yet the quality is pretty good.

## Content of the Book
 
The book Theory of Computation by Puntambekar has 12 chapters that cover the following topics:

1. Introduction: This chapter gives an overview of the subject and its applications.
2. Finite Automata: This chapter introduces deterministic and non-deterministic finite automata, their equivalence, minimization and applications.
3. Regular Expressions and Languages: This chapter defines regular expressions, regular languages and regular grammars, and their properties.
4. Properties of Regular Languages: This chapter discusses closure properties, pumping lemma, Myhill-Nerode theorem and decision algorithms for regular languages.
5. Context-Free Grammars: This chapter defines context-free grammars, parsing, ambiguity and simplification techniques.
6. Normal Forms for Context-Free Grammars: This chapter explains grammar transformations, Chomsky normal form and Greibach normal form.
7. Pushdown Automata: This chapter introduces non-deterministic and deterministic pushdown automata, their equivalence with context-free languages and applications.
8. Properties of Context-Free Languages: This chapter discusses closure properties, pumping lemma, Ogden's lemma and decision algorithms for context-free languages.
9. Turing Machines: This chapter defines Turing machines, their variants, extensions and applications.
10. Variations of Turing Machines: This chapter covers linear bounded automata, multi-tape Turing machines, multi-stack Turing machines and recursive enumerable languages.
11. Hierarchy of Languages: This chapter explains Chomsky hierarchy, regular hierarchy, context-sensitive hierarchy and recursive hierarchy.
12. Undecidability: This chapter introduces undecidable problems, Turing machine halting problem, Post correspondence problem and Rice's theorem.

## Exercises of the Book
 
The book Theory of Computation by Puntambekar has a large number of exercise questions at the end of each chapter. The questions are divided into two categories: short answer questions and long answer questions. The short answer questions are mostly objective type or fill in the blanks type. The long answer questions are mostly descriptive or analytical type. The questions cover all the concepts discussed in the chapters and are useful for practice and revision.
 
The book also provides solutions to some selected exercise questions at the end of the book. However, not all the questions have solutions provided. The readers may have to refer to other sources or consult their teachers for some questions. The book also does not provide any previous year GATE questions or mock tests for practice. The readers may have to use other books or online resources for that purpose.
