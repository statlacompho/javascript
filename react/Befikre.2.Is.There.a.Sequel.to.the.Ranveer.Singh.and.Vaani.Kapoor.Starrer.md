Since then, many fans have been wondering if there will be a sequel to Befikre, as the film ended on an open note with Dharam (Singh) and Shyra (Kapoor) deciding to give their relationship another chance. However, there has been no official announcement or confirmation from the makers or the actors about Befikre 2. In fact, Ranveer Singh has moved on to other projects like Padmaavat, Gully Boy, Simmba, Gully Boy 2 and '83, while Vaani Kapoor has appeared in War and Shamshera.
 
Therefore, it seems unlikely that Befikre 2 will happen anytime soon, unless Aditya Chopra decides to revisit the story of Dharam and Shyra with a fresh perspective and a new twist. Until then, fans can watch Befikre online on Amazon Prime Video[^2^] [^3^] or rent it on Google Play Movies, YouTube or Apple TV.

Befikre received mixed reviews from critics and audiences, who praised the performances of Singh and Kapoor, the music and the cinematography, but criticized the weak plot, the lack of originality and the clichÃ©d treatment of romance. The film has a rating of 52% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 21 reviews[^1^]. Some critics compared Befikre unfavorably to Chopra's previous films like Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge and Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi, and felt that he failed to capture the essence of the modern generation. Others appreciated his attempt to reinvent himself and make a light-hearted film that celebrated love and friendship.
 
Befikre was also a disappointment at the box office, as it failed to recover its production and marketing costs. The film had a decent opening weekend, but witnessed a sharp decline in collections thereafter. It was also affected by the demonetization of â¹500 and â¹1000 notes in India, which reduced the footfalls in theatres. The film's overseas performance was also below expectations, especially in markets like USA, UK and Australia. Befikre was one of the biggest flops of 2016 for Yash Raj Films.

Befikre did not receive any major awards or nominations, except for a few in the music category. The film's song "Nashe Si Chadh Gayi" sung by Arijit Singh was nominated for the Critics' Award for Best Vocalist of the Year (Male) at the Mirchi Music Awards, but did not win. The film's soundtrack composed by Vishal-Shekhar was praised for its catchy tunes and upbeat vibe, but was also criticized for being too generic and repetitive. The film's background score by Mikey McCleary was also appreciated for its fusion of Indian and French elements.
 
Befikre did not have any significant presence at the film festivals either, as it was not selected for any prestigious or popular events. The film's premiere was held in Dubai on December 8, 2016, a day before its worldwide release. The film's cast and crew also attended a special screening at the Rashtrapati Bhavan in New Delhi on December 12, 2016, where they met President Pranab Mukherjee and his daughter Sharmistha Mukherjee. The film's trailer was launched at the Eiffel Tower in Paris on October 10, 2016, making it the first Bollywood film to do so.
